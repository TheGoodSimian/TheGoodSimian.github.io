  <h>The Unfortunate Sex Life of The Banana</h>
<body>
  <div class="reader">
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">The humble banana almost seems like a miracle of nature.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Colourful, nutritious, and much cherished by children, monkeys and clowns, it has a favoured position in the planet’s fruitbowls.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The banana is vitally important in many regions of the tropics, where different parts of the plant are used for clothing, paper and tableware, and where the fruit itself is an essential dietary staple.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> People across the globe appreciate the soft, nourishing flesh, the snack-sized portions, and the easy-peel covering that conveniently changes colour to indicate ripeness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Individual fruit⁠⁠—or fingers⁠⁠—sit comfortably in the human hand, readily detached from their close-packed companions.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Indeed, the banana appears almost purpose-designed for efficient human consumption and distribution.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It is difficult to conceive of a more fortuitous fruit.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The banana, however, is a freakish and fragile genetic mutant; one that has survived through the centuries due to the sustained application of selective breeding by diligent humans.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Indeed, the “miraculous” banana is far from being a no-strings-attached gift from nature.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Its cheerful appearance hides a fatal flaw⁠⁠— one that threatens its proud place in the grocery basket.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The banana’s problem can be summed up in a single word: sex.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The banana plant is a hybrid, originating from the mismatched pairing of two South Asian wild plant species: Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Between these two products of nature, the former produces unpalatable fruit flesh, and the latter is far too seedy for enjoyable consumption.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Nonetheless, these closely related plants occasionally cross-pollinate and spawn seedlings which grow into sterile, half-breed banana plants.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Some ten thousand years ago, early human experimenters noted that some of these hybridized Musa bore unexpectedly tasty, seedless fruit with an unheard-of yellowness and inexplicably amusing shape.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They also proved an excellent source of carbohydrates and other important nutrients.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A seed-packed wild musa (banana) Despite the hybrid’s unfortunate sexual impotence, shrewd would-be agriculturalists realised that the plants could be cultivated from suckering shoots and cuttings taken from the underground stem.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The genetically identical progeny produced this way remained sterile, yet the new plant could be widely propagated with human help.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> An intensive and prolonged process of selective breeding⁠⁠—aided by the variety of hybrids and occasional random genetic mutations⁠⁠—eventually evolved the banana into its present familiar form.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Arab traders carried these new wonderfruit to Africa, and Spanish conquistadors relayed them onwards to the Americas.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thus the tasty new banana was spared from an otherwise unavoidable evolutionary dead-end.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Today, bananas and their close relatives, the starchy plantains, grow in a number of different varieties or cultivars.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Among temperate palates, the most familiar is the Cavendish, a shapely and sweet-tasting dessert banana.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This is the banana found in the supermarkets, splits, and milkshakes of the developed world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It is exported on an industrial scale from commercial plantations in the tropics.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Every Cavendish is genetically identical, possessing the same pleasant taste (which is somewhat lacking in more subtle flavours according to banana aficionados).</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They also all share the same potential for yellow curvaceousness and the same susceptibility to disease.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Although there are numerous other banana and plantain varieties cultivated for local consumption in Africa and Asia, none has the same worldwide appeal as the Cavendish.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> While these other varieties display more genetic variability, all come from the same sterile Musa hybrids which so delighted our forebears thousands of years ago.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Likewise none of them have enjoyed the benefits of the frenzied gene-shuffling facilitated by sexual congress.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Stuck with the clunky, inefficient cloning of asexual reproduction, the sterile banana is at a serious disadvantage in the never-ending biological arms race between plant and pest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Indeed, it is a well-established fact that bananas are particularly prone to crop-consuming insects and diseases.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A severe outbreak of banana disease could easily spread through the genetically uniform plantations, devastating economies and depriving our fruitbowls.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Varieties grown for local consumption would also suffer, potentially causing mass starvation in tropical regions.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Banana bunches in protective isolation.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This scenario may seem preposterous, but researchers all over the world are earnestly exploring the possibility.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The custodians of the beloved banana are all too aware of the potential for a banana apocalypse⁠⁠— because it has already happened in the fruit’s past.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And the next time could be much worse.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Until the middle of the twentieth century, most bananas on sale in the developed world belonged to the Gros Michel cultivar.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> These bananas were sweet and tasty and didn’t spoil too quickly, making them eminently suitable for commercial export.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Old-timers contend that in flavour and convenience, the Gros Michel outshone even the current top-banana, the Cavendish.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Yet from the early twentieth century, large plantations of ‘Big Mike’ proved increasingly fertile ground for a fungal leaf affliction known as Panama disease.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Affected crops would soon deteriorate into rotting piles of unprofitable vegetation.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As the century progressed, commercial growers found themselves in a desperate race against time, making doomed attempts to establish new plantations in disease-free areas of rainforest before the fungus arrived.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the 1950s the Vietnamese Cavendish came to the rescue.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Banana companies delayed switching from Big Mike for as long as possible due to the necessary changes in growing, storage, and ripening infrastructure, and many producers teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As Big Mike started pushing up daisies, banana plantations frantically reconfigured, and by the mid 1960s the changeover was largely complete.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The distinct⁠⁠—and now extinct⁠⁠—taste of Big Mike was quickly lost to the fickle public memory.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Cavendish was king.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It has done a sterling job in the intervening years, yet now the Cavendish is starting to struggle in its own contest against contagion.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the 1970s a disease named Black Sigatoka was beaten back with enthusiastic applications of pesticide, but more recently a new strain of the original bane of the banana has threatened the plantations.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Since 1992 a vigorous, pesticide-tolerant strain of Panama disease has been wiping out bananas⁠⁠—including previously resistant crops of Cavendish⁠⁠—in Southeast Asia.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It has yet to reach the large commercial plantations in Latin America, but most banana-watchers believe that this is only a matter of time.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A navel orange and its underdeveloped siamese twin Opinions differ on how long the Cavendish can survive the new onslaught, and on the best way to tackle the threat.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This time, unfortunately, there is no obvious back-up variety waiting in the wings.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So far, banana science has provided scant few approaches for improving disease resistance.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One method involves the traditional techniques of selective breeding: although banana plants are clones, very occasionally they can be persuaded to produce seeds through a painstaking process of hand pollination.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Only one fruit in three hundred will produce a seed, and of these seeds only one in three will have the correct chromosomal configuration to allow germination.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The seeds are laboriously extracted by straining tons of mashed fruit through fine meshes.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Research stations in commercial banana growing countries, such as Honduras, engage large squads of banana sex workers for such tasks, and to screen the new plant varieties for favourable characteristics.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Another fruit subject to such human-assisted reproduction is the ubiquitous navel orange.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It, too, was the result of a serendipitous mutation, this one from an orange tree in Brazil in the mid-1800s.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Each orange on this particular tree was found to have a tiny, underdeveloped twin sharing its skin, causing a navel-like formation opposite the stem.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> These strange siamese citruses were much sweeter than the fruit of their parent trees, and delightfully seedless.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Since the new tree was unable to reproduce naturally, caretakers amputated some of its limbs and grafted them onto other citrus trees to produce more of the desirable fruit.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Even today navel oranges are produced through such botanical surgery, and all of the navel oranges everywhere are direct descendants⁠⁠—essentially genetic clones⁠⁠—of those from that original tree.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As for the Cavendish, its last best hope may lie in genetic modification (GM).</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The University of Leuven in Belgium is a world centre in banana research due to its colonial connections with Africa.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Belgian banana scientists have become skilled in using DNA-transfer to introduce disease-resistance genes directly into the plant’s genome.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> These less labour-intensive methods promise a way to develop stronger, fitter, happier and more productive bananas.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In 2007, Ugandan field trials of the first Leuven uber-banana were announced, although public distaste of the idea of GM foods may impede its long term success.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And in Honduras, researchers have developed a banana cultivar named ‘Goldfinger’ through traditional selective breeding methods.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Although it has enjoyed some public acceptance in Australia, it suffers from the drawbacks of a distinctly different, non-Cavendish flavour, and a longer maturation time.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> If nothing else, these advances offer hope that science will one day overcome the unfortunate sexual inadequacies of the banana.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Let us hope so, otherwise the resulting bananageddon will ensure that the Cavendish goes the way of Big Mike, and future generations of fruit lovers will have to find some other curved yellow food to complement their ice cream.</div></div>
