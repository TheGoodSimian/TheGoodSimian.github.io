  <h1>Show & Tell</h1>
  <h2>A show-and-tell typically involves sharing an object or topic of interest with an audience. It lets you recount past experiences using the past tense, describe the current state of the object or your feelings towards it using the present tense, and sometimes talk about future possibilities using the future tense. </h2>

Meet Hootie, my adorable owl plushie! Hootie is a soft and cuddly stuffed toy, with big round eyes that seem to sparkle with mischief. With its fluffy brown and white feathers, it resembles a wise and friendly owl that you'd find in a magical forest. Hootie has tiny embroidered details on its wings and a cute little beak that gives it a sweet and endearing expression. It's the perfect companion for both children and adults alike, bringing a sense of comfort and warmth whenever you hold it close.

        <span class = past-simple> I received Hootie </span>as a thoughtful gift from my best friend on my birthday. We had visited a charming little gift shop during a weekend getaway to a picturesque town nestled in the countryside. As we browsed through the store's enchanting collection of stuffed animals, my eyes immediately locked onto this delightful owl plushie. My friend, who knows how much I adore owls, couldn't resist surprising me with Hootie as a symbol of our enduring friendship and to remind me of the joyous memories we shared during that trip.

Hootie holds a special place in my heart because it represents the bond between me and my best friend. Every time I look at it, I'm reminded of the cherished moments we spent exploring quaint shops, strolling through nature trails, and laughing until our cheeks hurt. Beyond being a cute and huggable toy, Hootie serves as a constant reminder of the love and support I have from my friend, no matter the distance between us. It's a comforting presence during tough times and a source of happiness during the good ones. Hootie's significance lies not just in its adorable appearance but in the beautiful memories and the meaningful friendship it represents, making it a treasured possession I'll always hold dear.
