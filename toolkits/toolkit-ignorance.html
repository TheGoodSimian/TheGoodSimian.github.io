    <h1>Expressing Ignorance in Language Learning</h1>
    <pre>
One of the key skills you should work on when you're starting to learn a language is expressing ignorance. If you can quickly and clearly let people know 
that you don't know a word or didn't understand something, it will save you a lot of time and stress, and will allow the other person to rephrase, explain, 
or translate what they said.

Here are two kinds of sentences you can use to express ignorance:

        I don't know what X means
        I didn't understand what you said

Let's look at some examples:

    I don't know what "toss" means.
        ~Oh, it means to throw something lightly.
    I see!

    I tossed the bag on the floor.
    I didn't understand what you said, can you rephrase it?
        ~I threw the bag on the floor.
    Oh, I get it now!
