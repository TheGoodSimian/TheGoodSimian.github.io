  <h1>Bio / Autodescription</h1>
  <h2>Notice that bios use a lot of perfect tenses, mostly present perfect simple and present perfect continuous.
    Can you explain why?</h2>
  <div class="bio-text" id="bioText">

    <p> Photography <span class="present-perfect">has always been</span> my greatest passion. I <span
        class="present-perfect">have been honing</span> my skills behind the lens for more than a decade now.
      Throughout my journey, I <span class="present-perfect">have captured</span> countless awe-inspiring photos,
      and my work <span class="present-perfect">has been featured</span> in several prestigious magazines and
      exhibitions.
    </p>
    <p> My adventures <span class="present-perfect">have taken</span> me to some of the most remote corners of the
      globe. I <span class="present-perfect">have hiked</span> through dense rainforests, having unforgettable
      encounters with exotic wildlife. I <span class="present-perfect">have also trekked</span> across vast deserts,
      marveling at the endless dunes and starry skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to photography, I <span class="present-perfect">have also been</span> involved in various
      philanthropic projects. I <span class="present-perfect">have volunteered</span> with organizations that focus on
      environmental conservation and community development. By working closely with these communities, I <span
        class="present-perfect">have been able to witness</span> the positive impact of collective efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I <span class="present-perfect">have been exploring</span> the art of storytelling through short films.
      The power of visual storytelling intrigues me, and I <span class="present-perfect">find joy</span> in conveying
      compelling narratives through my lens.
